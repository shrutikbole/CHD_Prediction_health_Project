# CHD_Prediction_health_Project

INTRODUCTION
Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) remains a critical global health concern, responsible for a substantial portion of cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality. Identifying individuals at risk of developing CHD is paramount for timely intervention and prevention efforts. This project aims to harness the power of data analysis and predictive modeling to better understand the factors associated with Ten-Year CHD risk and to build a reliable predictive model.

Dataset Description
The dataset under investigation contains information on individuals, including features such as age, education level, gender, smoking status, and various health-related measurements (e.g., cholesterol levels, blood pressure, BMI, and glucose levels). The dataset also includes a crucial target variable, "TenYearCHD," which indicates whether an individual is at risk of developing CHD within the next ten years (1 for at risk, 0 for not at risk).

Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

Data Exploration: Conduct a thorough exploration of the dataset to understand its structure, identify missing values, and gain insights into the distribution of key variables.

Feature Analysis: Analyze the dataset's features to determine their suitability for predicting Ten-Year CHD risk. Categorize features as numeric, categorical, ordinal, or nominal.

Dependency Analysis: Employ statistical tests, including the Chi-squared test for categorical features and t-tests or ANOVA for numeric features, to assess the dependency of each feature on the Ten-Year CHD target variable.

Data Preprocessing: Prepare the dataset for modeling by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling or normalizing numeric features.

Model Building: Develop predictive models using machine learning algorithms to predict Ten-Year CHD risk based on the selected features.

Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the developed models using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, ROC curve) to determine their predictive capability.

Interpretation: Interpret the results to identify the most influential factors contributing to Ten-Year CHD risk.
